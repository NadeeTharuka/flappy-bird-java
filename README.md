# Flappy Bird - Java AWT/Swing Project

## Project Overview

This is a Flappy Bird game developed using Java's AWT (Abstract Window Toolkit) and Swing libraries. The player controls a bird that must navigate between randomly generated pipes by "flapping" (jumping) to avoid obstacles. The goal is to survive as long as possible, with a running score counting the number of pipes successfully passed.

## Features
- Graphical Interface: Utilizes JFrame and JPanel for the main window and rendering the game elements.
- Flappy Bird Movement: Clicking or pressing a key causes the bird to jump (flap).
- Random Pipe Generation: Pipes appear randomly and move horizontally across the screen.
- Collision Detection: The game detects collisions between the bird and the pipes or ground, ending the game if a collision occurs.
- Score Tracking: Players score points by passing through the pipes.

## Gameplay Instructions
- Flap: Click the mouse or press the spacebar to make the bird jump and avoid the pipes.
- Objective: Keep the bird in the air while avoiding the pipes. Your score increases with each pipe you pass through.

## How to Play
- Click or press the spacebar to make the bird jump.
- Avoid hitting the pipes or the ground.
- Survive as long as you can and try to achieve the highest score possible!

Future Improvements
- Pause and Restart Options: Add functionality to pause the game and restart after a game over.
- Advanced Graphics: Implement smoother animations and more visually appealing backgrounds.
- Mobile Controls: Adapt the game to be playable on touch-screen devices.
